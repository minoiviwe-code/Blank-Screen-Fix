# Ubuntu Pools Governance Charter

## Purpose

Ubuntu Pools exists to enable collective financial coordination, trust-based governance, and transparent decision-making rooted in the principle of Ubuntu:

> “I am because we are.”

The platform is designed to prioritize:
- Collective accountability
- Transparent governance
- Consent-based coordination
- Non-custodial architecture

## Stewardship Model

Ubuntu Pools is intended to outlive any single contributor.

No individual permanently owns the system.

Instead, the project is governed through:
- Explicit constitutions
- Role-based authority
- Auditable decision-making
- Community participation

## Founding Acknowledgment

Ubuntu Pools was initiated and founded by **Mihle Majokweni**.

This acknowledgment records origin, not ownership.

The founder holds no inherent permanent authority by virtue of authorship alone. Authority derives from governance rules encoded in the system and accepted by participants.

## Interim Governance Roles (Current)

Until formal decentralization or institutional handover:

- Interim Lead Technical Executive: Mihle Majokweni  
- Interim Lead Compliance Officer: Mihle Majokweni  
- Interim Lead Governance Officer: Mila Mafuya  

These roles exist to:
- Safeguard system integrity
- Enforce governance discipline
- Protect participants during early phases

## Alignment With Board Directives

Board-issued directives are treated as binding program constraints. Governance decisions must be:
- Transparent
- Documented
- Auditable
- Constitutionally valid

## Future Governance

As Ubuntu Pools matures, governance authority may transition to:
- Multi-signature councils
- Community-elected stewards
- Independent foundations
- Cooperative or trust-based structures

Any transition must be:
- Transparent
- Documented
- Auditable
- Constitutionally valid

## Principle of Continuity

Ubuntu Pools is larger than any individual.

Yet its origin, values, and initial stewardship form part of its permanent historical record.

Governance exists not to erase founders, but to prevent domination — and to ensure the system serves people rather than power.
